## Notes for Product Management

- The increase in AI Performance issues aligns with the recent integration of adaptive neural networks. While users are noticing improvements, there are still consistency challenges to address.
- McOS integration remains a pain point, supporting the decision to focus on this area in our roadmap.
- Despite some issues, overall user satisfaction is trending upward, indicating that our recent improvements are having a positive impact.
- The relatively low number of security/privacy issues is encouraging, but their high severity underscores the need for continued vigilance in this area.
